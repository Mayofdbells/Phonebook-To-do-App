...to-do app with phone-book feature
I wanted to create a app like a phone-book with also "to-do" features, so basically, you select a contact and a list of options pops out asking what you wish to do with the selected 
contact and after selection or typing in what you wish to do (task), it will go off the task-list.I just started though...more codes coming
